Hi there! I’m Kenneth. I’m a software developer who is passionate about creating great products.

My first experience with programming was when I was working on my master's thesis in economics in 2008, but I didn’t go far with it. I had developed some macroeconomic models, analyzed big data. All that was left was to apply code. Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to apply the economics knowledge and skills as well but instead went into the Taxi business which I operated until the beginning of 2020. However, the onslaught of Covid -19 Virus brought the business completely to a standstill as people restricted their movement in fear of contracting the Virus.

I decided to try learning Python with the hope that I would get back into the labour market and that I would combine my economics background with programming. It was a radically different experience. I distinctly remember the moment it clicked; I was watching the forex charts, and they were predicting the price movements for the week by using indicators. The prediction was right, and it occurred to me that actually historical data was used to predict future prices. It occurred to me that I had skills in working with data!

However, since I was in a bad financial situation, the course which I was paying for from my savings, was taking a toll on me. Luckily enough the government, through the Arbetsförmedlingen (Labour office) was helping those who had lost jobs in sectors that had been hit hard by the pandemic, acquire skills through courses.  I had two options, to continue with Python or start a .NET Systemutvecklare course. I opted for the latter as I would also have  C# among my arsenal of programming languages.

Since then, I’ve been honing my skills and learning technologies in the .NET family. I recently graduated from Lexicon Yrekesutbildning 7-month intensive .NET Systemutvecklare course. I am working as a freelance backend developer.  My main interests when it comes to programming are back-end development, server-side operations, including CRUD functions with database and all server logic and APIs, and anything that can make life easier for business entities. I’m seeking a full-time role where I can help a company achieve their goals.
