subtitle: Creating a backend for an angular application.
---
In this application, I focused on the futures that require the interaction between a frontend application and a backend service built with ASP.NET Web API. The angular application reaches out to the server with a request, and the backend server returns the response with data from the database. The futures include;

*   Retrieving, filtering, shaping, querying, and saving data.

*   Error handling.

*   User Authentication and Authorization

The application will also allow the user to update and create new information which will be saved to the database on the backend server
