  Creating a RESTful API using node.js,express and Mongodb.(MERN) for server and
  CRUD application
---
REST API  application where the user will interact with the backend by making orders from the database.

#### **STACK**

MongoDB, Javascript, API, VS Code, Node.js, Postman.

**VIEW LIVE**Â **SITE**

#### **Project Purpose and Goal.**

The purpose of the project will be to;

*   Create REST API using MongoDB, Express, and Node

*   Create CRUD operations to interact with the backend database

*   Create Authentication for the user.

#### **WebStack and Explanation.**

I preferred using VS Code because of its easy-to-use interface and syntax highlighting. Node did most of the heavy lifting as it is used to install all the dependencies for the project. These included express, mongoose,dotnet,bcrypt.js, express-async-handler, jsonwebtocken. Express made it easier to create the server. Nodemon automatically saves all the changes made to our files instead of restarting the server every single time. MangoDB database is connected to server.js. Authentication is by web tokens and password hashing. In the end, Postman is used for testing the routes.
