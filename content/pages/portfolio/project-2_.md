[**VIEW LIVE** **SITE**](https://okalangkenneth.github.io/weather_app/)

#### **Project Purpose and Goal.**

The purpose of the project will be to create an account with the Open Weather Map site, obtain the API key and learn about the documentation, and with a goal of building a simple application using JSON, AJAX, and data using a 3rd party API.

#### **WebStack and Explanation.**

By loading JSON data from the Weather Underground site using an API, one sets the city's name in the code, the data returned reveals the location, the current temperature, weather description, and a 3-day weather forecast.

#### **Problems and Thought Process.**

#### **Lessons Learnt.**
